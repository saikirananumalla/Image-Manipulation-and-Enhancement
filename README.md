# Image Manipulation and Enhancement


This application can perform image manipulation and enhancement on supported file formats like PPM,
PNG and JPG. This application can flip, brighten, darken, compress and apply different types of
effects to an image such as blurring, sharpening, converting to sepia tone, generating a histogram,
color correcting and levels adjusting for an Image. It has extended functionality to generate a 
split view image which has the transformed image and original image side-by-side. This split
operation is supported by the blur, sharpen, sepia, luma-component aka greyscale, color-correct and
levels-adjust operations. 

`The application program can be launched in three ways:`

java -jar project.jar -file path-of-script-file : when invoked in this manner the program opens
the script file, executes it and shuts down.

java -jar project.jar -text : when invoked in this manner the program opens an interactive cli
mode, which allows the user to type the script and execute it one line at a time.

java -jar project.jar : when invoked in this manner the program opens the graphical user
interface.
